# Day 19

https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/19

I ended up brute-force puzzling the world together. As the world grows,
matching new pieces to it slows down, so I also tried matching
individual pieces into pairs (with relative offset and rotation) first
and then use a DFS to build the world, but it turned out matching all
the pairs took longer than puzzling the world together.

Probably could be done more optimal by pre-calculating sub-cubes of size
12 and creating fingerprints? But I got away with this slow approach.

```
c++ -std=c++17 -O2 main.cpp -o main

# Usage:
# ./main <input filename>

./main input.txt
```
